# Deployment Issues & Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve production deployment issues that don't occur in local development.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Date Overflow in Experience Timeline
**Problem**: Dates in the experience section were overflowing on smaller screens in production.

**Root Cause**: Production builds handle responsive breakpoints differently, and the date containers weren't properly constrained.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added responsive text handling with `truncate` classes
- Implemented mobile-specific date formatting (showing only year)
- Added proper flex constraints with `min-w-0` and `flex-shrink-0`
- Created `.experience-date` CSS class with max-width constraints

### 2. Laggy Transitions and Animations
**Problem**: Smooth animations in development became laggy in production.

**Root Cause**: Production builds optimize differently, and resource-intensive animations weren't properly throttled.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created production-specific performance settings in `BackgroundScene.tsx`
- Reduced particle count and geometry complexity for production
- Disabled expensive features (lighting, post-processing) in production
- Added frame rate throttling and animation complexity reduction
- Implemented static background fallback for low-end devices
- Created `productionOptimizations.ts` utility for consistent optimizations

### 3. 3D Background Performance Issues
**Problem**: Three.js background scene caused performance issues on deployed site.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added production environment detection
- Reduced particle count from 1000+ to 300-600 in production
- Disabled antialiasing and high-performance GPU preference in production
- Created `StaticBackground.tsx` as lightweight fallback
- Added automatic fallback for mobile and low-end devices
- Implemented proper resource cleanup and memory management

## Testing the Fixes

### Local Testing
```bash
# Build and preview production version
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Deployment Testing
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Test on various devices and screen sizes
3. Check browser developer tools for performance issues
4. Verify responsive behavior matches local development

### Diagnostics
The app now includes automatic diagnostics in development mode. Check the browser console for:
- Environment detection
- Device capabilities
- Performance metrics
- Identified issues and optimizations

## Monitoring

### Performance Metrics
- Frame rate monitoring for 3D background
- Memory usage tracking
- Device capability detection
- Network connection quality assessment

### Error Tracking
- WebGL support detection
- Resource loading failures
- Animation performance issues
- Responsive layout problems

## Future Improvements

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Further optimize for different device tiers
2. **Adaptive Loading**: Implement more sophisticated performance-based feature loading
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Add production performance monitoring
4. **A/B Testing**: Test different optimization strategies
5. **CDN Integration**: Optimize asset delivery for global performance

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm run build` to apply all optimizations
- [ ] Test responsive behavior on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify 3D background performance or fallback activation
- [ ] Check console for diagnostic information
- [ ] Test on slow network connections
- [ ] Verify all animations are smooth
- [ ] Check text overflow on various screen sizes
- [ ] Confirm proper error boundaries are working

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after deployment:

1. Check browser console for diagnostic information
2. Test with different device types and screen sizes
3. Verify network conditions aren't affecting performance
4. Consider enabling static background fallback for all production users
5. Review server configuration for proper asset delivery
