# Accessibility Features

This document outlines the comprehensive accessibility features implemented in the Java Developer Portfolio website.

## Overview

The portfolio has been designed with accessibility as a core principle, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact with the content effectively.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Error Handling

#### Error Boundaries
- **General Error Boundary**: Catches and handles React component errors gracefully
- **WebGL Error Boundary**: Specifically handles WebGL-related errors with appropriate fallbacks
- **Section-level Error Boundaries**: Each major section has its own error boundary to prevent cascading failures

#### Error Recovery
- Retry functionality for recoverable errors
- Graceful degradation when features are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

#### Focus Management
- **Focus Trapping**: Modal dialogs and mobile menus trap focus appropriately
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus indicators on all interactive elements
- **Skip Links**: "Skip to main content" link for keyboard users
- **Logical Tab Order**: All interactive elements follow a logical tab sequence

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate through skill cards and project items
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and links
- **Escape**: Close modals and mobile menus
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate forward/backward through focusable elements

### 3. Screen Reader Support

#### ARIA Labels and Roles
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of semantic elements (header, nav, main, section, article)
- **ARIA Labels**: Descriptive labels for all interactive elements
- **ARIA Roles**: Appropriate roles for custom components
- **ARIA States**: Dynamic state information (expanded, pressed, selected)

#### Live Regions
- **Status Updates**: Important status changes announced to screen readers
- **Loading States**: Loading progress and completion announcements
- **Error Messages**: Error states communicated via live regions

### 4. Visual Accessibility

#### Color and Contrast
- **WCAG AA Compliance**: All text meets minimum contrast ratios
- **High Contrast Support**: Respects user's high contrast preferences
- **Color Independence**: Information not conveyed by color alone

#### Typography
- **Readable Fonts**: Clear, legible font choices
- **Scalable Text**: Text scales properly with browser zoom
- **Adequate Spacing**: Proper line height and letter spacing

### 5. Motion and Animation

#### Reduced Motion Support
- **Prefers-Reduced-Motion**: Respects user's motion preferences
- **Alternative Animations**: Static alternatives for complex animations
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced animation complexity on request

#### Animation Controls
- **Pause Functionality**: Users can pause auto-playing animations
- **Speed Controls**: Adjustable animation speeds where appropriate

### 6. Responsive Design

#### Mobile Accessibility
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile
- **Gesture Alternatives**: Keyboard alternatives for gesture-based interactions
- **Orientation Support**: Works in both portrait and landscape modes

#### Flexible Layouts
- **Zoom Support**: Layout remains functional at 200% zoom
- **Reflow**: Content reflows appropriately on small screens

## Technical Implementation

### Hooks

#### `useKeyboardNavigation`
Provides keyboard navigation functionality for components:
```typescript
const { focusFirst, focusLast } = useKeyboardNavigation({
  containerRef,
  onEscape: () => closeModal(),
  trapFocus: true
});
```

#### `useReducedMotion`
Detects and respects user's motion preferences:
```typescript
const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();
// Conditionally apply animations based on preference
```

#### `useAnnouncer`
Provides screen reader announcements:
```typescript
const { announce } = useAnnouncer();
announce('Page loaded successfully');
```

### Utilities

#### Accessibility Helper Functions
- `getFocusableElements()`: Find all focusable elements in a container
- `trapFocus()`: Implement focus trapping
- `announceToScreenReader()`: Make announcements to screen readers
- `createAccessibleButtonProps()`: Generate proper button attributes
- `createAccessibleLinkProps()`: Generate proper link attributes

### Components

#### Error Boundaries
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly fallbacks
- Development-specific error details
- Recovery options for users

#### Accessible UI Components
- All interactive components include proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard event handlers for custom interactions
- Focus management for complex components

## Testing

### Automated Testing
The `AccessibilityTest` component (development only) performs automated checks:
- Reduced motion detection
- High contrast support
- Focusable elements validation
- ARIA labels presence
- Semantic HTML structure
- Form labels association
- Color contrast (basic check)
- Screen reader announcements
- Keyboard navigation

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Tab through all interactive elements
- [ ] Verify focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Test skip links functionality
- [ ] Verify modal focus trapping
- [ ] Test escape key functionality

#### Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] Test with NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver
- [ ] Verify all content is announced
- [ ] Check heading structure
- [ ] Verify form labels
- [ ] Test live region announcements

#### Visual Testing
- [ ] Test at 200% zoom
- [ ] Verify high contrast mode
- [ ] Test with reduced motion enabled
- [ ] Check color contrast ratios
- [ ] Verify touch target sizes

## Browser Support
